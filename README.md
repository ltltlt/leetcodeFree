# Solve leetcode 1000 problems

## Steps

1. For first 1000 problems in leetcode, divide them into batch with each batch size about 100, considering the best solution for eash problem in 20/10/5 minutes(hard/medium/easy)
2a. Solution came out, then wrote it, and compare the time and space complexity with the best solution(online or via discussion)
2b. No solution came out, check the best solution, understand it, and skip it
3. We might miss some problems in 2b, go through this batch again, and retry previous steps until no problems unsolved

## Goals

1. Know how to solve problems as much as possible
2. Save time to writing code, and entangled with language features

## NonGoals

1. Use programming language to implement them
2. Solve it totally on my own
